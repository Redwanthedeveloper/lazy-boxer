                Who would ever think a laid back sad eyed gentleman named
                Winford Boxward would become the Lazy Boxer. A story about a
                geeky bright-eyed gaming programmer who creates a virtual boxer
                to fight for a good cause. Winford won and was awarded a crypto
                wallet that changed his life forever. It is with this spirit
                that the Lazy Boxer was created. The Lazy Boxer became a crypto
                rock star and an advocate for other crypto lazy boxers who
                personifies him in the metaverse sports world boxing arena.
